This program performs **neural style transfer** using a TensorFlow Hub model. It loads content and style images, applies the style, and saves the stylized image to a specified output path. The program also displays the content, style, and generated images. If TensorFlow or TensorFlow Hub is not installed, it prompts an error and exits. Any errors during the process are handled gracefully.
